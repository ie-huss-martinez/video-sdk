# Working in this repository

This repository is part of the `@hussmartinez` SDK family and is public. Treat it as a showcase: code, commits and pull requests should read as professional work.

It publishes `@hussmartinez/video-sdk`: a headless core for editing video, a React editor (`VideoEditor`) and the `<hm-video-editor>` custom element. Everything runs on the user's device; videos never leave it.

## Before changing anything

- Read [`STANDARDS.md`](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/blob/main/STANDARDS.md) in `sdk-core`. It is binding for every repository in the family.
- Check the decision records before changing anything they cover. Family-wide decisions live in [`sdk-core`'s `docs/adr`](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/tree/main/docs/adr); decisions specific to this repository live in `docs/adr` here. To change a decision, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one, in the same pull request as the change. A change to a family-wide decision belongs in `sdk-core`, not here.
- The records that matter most here are [0004](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/blob/main/docs/adr/0004-entry-points-and-module-format.md) (entry points), [0007](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/blob/main/docs/adr/0007-server-rendering-and-nextjs.md) (server rendering), [0008](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/blob/main/docs/adr/0008-ports-adapters-and-session.md) and [0017](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/blob/main/docs/adr/0017-core-errors-and-shared-runtime-imports.md) (layers), [0009](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/blob/main/docs/adr/0009-features-as-tools.md) (features as tools), [0010](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/blob/main/docs/adr/0010-edits-as-commands.md) (edits as commands), [0011](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/blob/main/docs/adr/0011-worker-messaging-and-assets.md) and [0018](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/blob/main/docs/adr/0018-worker-rpc-protocol.md) (workers and assets), [0012](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/blob/main/docs/adr/0012-hostile-input-and-no-network.md) and [0020](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/blob/main/docs/adr/0020-file-policy.md) (hostile input and limits), and [0014](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/blob/main/docs/adr/0014-accessibility-and-translatable-text.md) and [0019](https://github.com/ie-huss-martinez/sdk-core/blob/main/docs/adr/0019-message-catalogues.md) (accessibility and text).

## Making changes

- **Pull requests:** work on a branch and open one focused pull request per change. Never push to `main`; it is protected.
- **One pull request at a time:** after opening a pull request, stop and report its link, a short summary and your `pnpm verify` result. Start the next change only once it's merged, from an up-to-date `main`.
- **Never merge your own pull request:** a separate reviewer reads the full diff, runs `pnpm verify` independently for code changes, and squash-merges it. An agent that wrote a pull request never reviews or merges it. See [How pull requests are reviewed](CONTRIBUTING.md#how-pull-requests-are-reviewed).
- **Pull request descriptions:** cover what changed, why, and how it was tested. They can be as detailed as useful, because they don't go into git history.
- **Squash commits:** the merger writes the commit message on `main`. Its title is the pull request title plus `(#N)`, and its body is 2–6 lines of plain prose. See [How pull requests are merged](CONTRIBUTING.md#how-pull-requests-are-merged).
- **Commits:** follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `chore:`). The pull request title becomes the squash commit, so write it as a Conventional Commit too.
- **Changesets:** a pull request that changes the published package's source or `package.json` adds a changeset with `pnpm changeset`. Write its note for the package's users: what changed for them, the API they'll see, and how to migrate if it breaks. Versions and changelogs come from changesets, not commits. See [Changesets](CONTRIBUTING.md#changesets).
- **Signing:** commits are signed; don't disable signing.
- **No attribution:** don't add AI or tool attribution to commits or pull requests.
- **ADRs:** add one for any significant decision, meaning anything affecting public API, cross-package consistency or security, or that is hard to reverse.
- **Other repositories:** don't edit them from here. If this repository needs a change elsewhere, such as a shared helper in `@hussmartinez/sdk-core` or a component in `@hussmartinez/ui`, propose it in that repository.

## Video SDK rules

These follow from the standards; they're repeated here because they apply to almost every change in this repository.

- **Layers:** code lives in `src/core` (`model`, `errors`, `operations`, `ports`, `session`), `src/adapters`, `src/workers`, `src/features`, `src/react`, `src/element` and `src/messages`. The core never imports React, `@hussmartinez/ui`, an adapter or a feature. `dependency-cruiser` enforces the layer rules.
- **Hostile input:** video bytes are demuxed and decoded only in workers. A file's limits are checked from a probe that walks every packet, never from header counts, before any decoder is configured, and every decoded frame is checked again against the probe. The demuxer is hostile-input code: its integration has truncation, garbage and property-based fuzz tests, and a malformed file fails with an error code, never a hang. Nothing from a file, such as metadata or a file name, is ever inserted as HTML. Size, frame-pixel, frame-rate, duration, bitrate, packet-size, track, channel, sample-rate, clip and time limits come from `defineLimits` and fail with their own error codes.
- **Memory:** decoded media is streamed, never held whole. Decoder and encoder queues are bounded, and every `VideoFrame` and `AudioData` is closed on every path, including seek, cancellation, errors and teardown.
- **Privacy:** exports carry only the metadata the user sets. Metadata from source files, such as location or the recording device, is never copied into an export.
- **No network:** the SDK makes no requests of its own: no CDN workers, codecs, fonts or telemetry. Usage events go only to the host's `onEvent`, and never contain file names or contents.
- **Workers:** pages and workers talk through `createWorkerClient` and `exposeWorker` from `sdk-core`. Caller buffers are copied unless the caller opts into transferring them. WebCodecs decoders and encoders run only in workers. Worker assets are inlined by default, and hosts can self-host them through `assets`; the README documents the CSP for both.
- **Errors:** `VideoError` extends `SdkError`, with stable `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` codes. User-facing text is looked up by code in the message catalogue, never taken from `error.message`.
- **Edits and tools:** every edit is a serialisable command run by the session, with undo and redo. Every feature is a folder under `src/features/` registered with `defineTool`.
- **Entry points:** `.` is server-safe, with no React and no DOM access on import; `./react` starts with `"use client"`; `./element` registers nothing on import. Library code never imports CSS.
- **Styles and text:** styles live in the `hm.sdk` layer, with `.hm-video-*` classes and values from `--hm-*` tokens. Shared controls come from `@hussmartinez/ui`. Every visible string and accessible name comes from `src/messages/en.ts`.
- **Third-party code:** every bundled library's licence must be compatible with Apache-2.0, and `NOTICE` credits each one whose licence requires it. Bundled engines are pinned to an exact version and never modified, and each upgrade is its own pull request that runs the contract tests and end-to-end fixtures.

## Verifying changes

- **Hooks:** they run automatically: linting and a secret scan on commit, commit message checks, and `pnpm verify:fast` on push. Never use `--no-verify`. If a hook is wrong or too slow, fix it in its own pull request.
- **Before marking a pull request ready,** run the full `pnpm verify` locally and report its results in the description.
- **CI:** it runs `pnpm verify` on Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, checks the pull request title, and checks for a changeset when the published package changes. All three must pass before merging. CI is the final gate, not a substitute for local verification.
- **Never weaken a check to make it pass.** That includes lint rules, size budgets, the API report, accessibility checks, file limits and the no-network assertion. Fix the cause, or propose the change in its own pull request with an ADR if the rule itself is wrong.
