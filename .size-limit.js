/**
 * Size budgets per entry point (ADR 0015): the brotli size of each built
 * entry, with the shared chunks it loads. They measure the unminified files in
 * dist, an upper bound: applications ship less, because their bundler
 * minifies and drops what they don't import.
 *
 * These are starting ceilings for what each entry should hold. Worker
 * and video engine code loads lazily in its own chunks, which get
 * their own budgets when they're added. The feature pull requests revisit
 * these against real sizes.
